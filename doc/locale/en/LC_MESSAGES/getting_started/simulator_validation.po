"图中左侧对比了在 **NPU-SIM** 上运行的 **Qwen3_4B** 模型与在 **Ascend-NPU-910B** "
"硬件上运行时的端到端延迟。实验在不同的解码序列长度（128 和 256）以及批大小（8 到 64）下进行。在相同的硬件配置条件下， **NPU-"
"SIM** 的模拟运行时间与真实硬件的执行时间高度一致。尽管真实执行会受到硬件资源利用率和软件优化等因素影响， **NPU-SIM** "
"仍然能够保持与实际性能趋势的一致性。"

"The left side of the figure compares the end-to-end latency of the "
"**Qwen3_4B** model running on **NPU-SIM** versus on actual **Ascend-"
"NPU-910B** hardware. The experiments were conducted with different decoding "
"sequence lengths (128 and 256) and batch sizes (8 to 64). Under the same "
"hardware configuration, the simulation runtime of **NPU-SIM** closely "
"matches the execution time on the actual hardware. Although real execution "
"can be affected by factors such as hardware resource utilization and "
"software optimization, **NPU-SIM** still maintains consistency with the "
"actual performance trend."

"在 **NPU-SIM** "
"中，各个组件均可独立配置不同的仿真模式，主要分为两种：时钟精确级，即在每一个硬件的时钟周期进行一次组件的状态计算和更新。此仿真模式具有较高的仿真精确度，但仿真耗时较高；另一种行为级仿真，则是采用了"
" **屋檐模型** ，可以跳过重复的周期仿真，将硬件组件的行为用模型近似，在丢失较少仿真精度的情况下，大幅加快仿真速度。"

"In **NPU-SIM**, each component can be independently configured with "
"different simulation modes, primarily divided into two types: cycle-"
"accurate, which performs state calculation and updates for the component at "
"each hardware clock cycle. This simulation mode offers high accuracy but "
"requires longer simulation time; the other is behavioral-level simulation, "
"which uses the **eave model**, allowing it to skip repetitive cycle "
"simulations and approximate the behavior of hardware components with models,"
" significantly accelerating simulation speed while sacrificing minimal "
"accuracy."

"图中右侧展示了两种仿真模式对运行效率和准确性的影响。我们在 **Qwen3_4B** 的不同工作负载下进行测试，其中前三个（C1 到 "
"C3）代表内存密集型场景，其余则代表计算密集型场景。结果表明，在内存密集型场景中，基于性能模型的仿真可以将实时执行开销降低 4.93 倍到 11.27 "
"倍，但会带来最高达 38.56% 的误差；而在计算密集型场景中，由于计算过程是确定性的，准确性可以保持在 3% 以内。"

"The right side of the figure illustrates the impact of two simulation modes "
"on runtime efficiency and accuracy. We tested under different workloads of "
"**Qwen3_4B**, where the first three (C1 to C3) represent memory-intensive "
"scenarios, and the rest represent compute-intensive scenarios. The results "
"show that in memory-intensive scenarios, performance model-based simulation "
"can reduce real-time execution overhead by 4.93x to 11.27x, but introduces "
"an error of up to 38.56%; whereas in compute-intensive scenarios, since the "
"computation process is deterministic, accuracy can be maintained within 3%."
